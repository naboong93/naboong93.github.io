# About Me
There is no specific format here. You can fill out the form you want.  
For example, you might want to write a brief introduction about your self, experience, interests, publications, and other information.  
I wrote "about me", "career", and "interests" on this page as an example.

# Career
* First Company (2018/04 ~ )
  * C# Winform Application
    * Platform
  * Java Web Application
    * Rest Api

<br/>

# Interests
I am interested in technology trends.  
I'm not afraid to learn languages, but I enjoy using Python.  
I like to automate and reduce annoying things.
